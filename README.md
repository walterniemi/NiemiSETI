## 📘 Featured Notebook: `Prime19_SignalDecoder.ipynb`

This notebook represents one of the most refined symbolic decoding attempts in the NiemiSETI project. Focused on a gravitational-wave anomaly labeled **"Prime 19"**, it explores whether post-spike symbolic structuring and prime-lattice encoding are present within a filtered segment of LIGO data.

### 📎 Key Functions

- Loads high-resolution frequency and amplitude datasets from multiple detectors.
- Filters a critical band (1–17.3 Hz) for detailed post-spike analysis.
- Applies symbolic decoding, harmonic segmentation, and prime-interval mapping.

### ✅ Tests Performed and Insights Gained

**1. Frequency Spike Isolation & Timestamp Gapping**  
*Purpose:* To determine whether the signal following a spike (an anomaly) carries structured delays.  
*Result:* Gaps between frequency pulses revealed a narrow band of recurring intervals consistent with recursive modulation patterns.

**2. Prime Interval Detection**  
*Purpose:* To check whether the post-anomaly symbolic intervals correspond to prime number gaps.  
*Result:* Nearly all post-event symbolic jumps matched consecutive prime intervals (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11...), suggesting engineered modulation unlikely to occur randomly.

**3. Harmonic Ratio Mapping**  
*Purpose:* To test whether successive symbolic gaps align with harmonic musical ratios (like 5:3 or 8:5).  
*Result:* Clusters of frequency intervals revealed consistent harmonic relations, reinforcing the hypothesis of encoded structure.

**4. Symbolic Bitstream Conversion**  
*Purpose:* To transform frequency gaps into symbolic representations for downstream analysis (e.g., 0s and 1s).  
*Result:* Bitstreams showed internal repetition, possible framing patterns, and symbolic sync markers.

**5. Wavelet Transform Analysis**  
*Purpose:* To detect frequency persistence and modulation behavior across time.  
*Result:* Localized, non-random frequency structures emerged around the anomaly event, validated using Morlet wavelets.

**6. N-Gram Frequency Analysis**  
*Purpose:* To assess whether repeating 2- or 3-symbol sequences exist, possibly indicating block encoding.  
*Result:* Several n-gram sequences repeated far above statistical baseline, hinting at instruction-set-like behavior.

**7. Change-Point Detection & Symbolic Framing**  
*Purpose:* To check for transition markers or frame-like boundaries in the post-anomaly sequence.  
*Result:* Rare symbols appeared at consistent positions, suggestive of sync bytes or protocol headers.

### 💡 Why This Matters

This notebook isn’t just a technical showcase—it represents a **conceptual leap** in treating gravitational-wave anomalies not as noise, but as **symbolic streams** potentially aligned with **engineered encoding laws**.

The `Prime19_SignalDecoder.ipynb` delivers:

- Strong **mathematical evidence** that the anomaly is non-random.
- Proof of concept for **symbolic sequence modeling** within GW data.
- A modular platform that can scale to other segments or detectors.
- Foundational structure for recursive AI decoding pipelines.

> This notebook stands at the heart of NiemiSETI’s hypothesis:  
> **that structured, symbolic intelligence may be encoded in the least likely place—gravitational time-frequency space.**
